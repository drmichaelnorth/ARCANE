# ARCANE
AnticipatoRy Complex Adaptive Network Extrapolation (ARCANE)
ARCANE is a genetic algorithm system for automatically generating system
dynamics models that differ in both their embedded parameters and their
fundamental equations while maintaining dimensional consistency. It is
intended to be used for anticipatory modeling of systems such as complex
networks.
