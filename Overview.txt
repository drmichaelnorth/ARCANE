The AnticipatoRy Complex Adaptive Network Extrapolation (ARCANE) library
is a genetic algorithm system for automatically generating anticipatory
models that differ in both their embedded parameters and their fundamental
equations while maintaining dimensional consistency. It is intended to be
used for anticipatory modeling of systems such as complex networks. A
reference for the ARCANE API can be found in the "docs" directory.
